# Aether Platform

**Full-stack behavioral analytics, identity resolution, and AI-powered insights platform with Web3 support.**

Aether is a modular analytics platform that captures user behavior across web, mobile, and Web3 touchpoints, resolves identities across sessions and devices, runs ML predictions (churn, LTV, journey forecasting), and orchestrates campaigns — all with GDPR compliance and SOC 2 readiness built in.

# Install monorepo dependencies
npm install

# Run the playground
cd playground && npm run dev

# Run backend
cd "Backend Architecture/aether-backend" && python3 main.py

## Key Capabilities

### Analytics & Identity
- Behavioral event tracking (page views, clicks, scrolls, custom events)
- Cross-device identity resolution via graph database
- Session management with automatic timeout and resumption
- Web3 wallet connection tracking

### Machine Learning
- **Edge models** (< 100ms, browser-side): Intent prediction, bot detection, session scoring
- **Server models** (SageMaker): Churn, LTV, journey prediction, anomaly detection, attribution
- Model monitoring with drift detection and automated retraining

### Compliance
- GDPR: 7 data protection controls, 6 data subject rights, consent management, breach notification
- SOC 2: 5 trust criteria, 34 controls, gap analysis, continuous compliance monitoring
- Record of Processing Activities (ROPA), cross-border transfer tracking

### Infrastructure
- Multi-account AWS (production, staging, data, security)
- Multi-AZ with DR (RPO 1h, RTO 4h)
- CI/CD with quality gates (coverage 85%, security scanning, performance budgets)
