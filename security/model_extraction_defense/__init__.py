Aether Security — Model Extraction Defense

Modular defense layer against model extraction and knowledge distillation
attacks. Integrates as middleware into the ML serving pipeline.

Components:
  - QueryRateLimiter:        Per-key + per-IP sliding window limits
  - QueryPatternDetector:    Sweep, similarity, entropy, timing analysis
  - OutputPerturbationLayer: Logit noise, top-k clipping, entropy smoothing
  - ModelWatermark:          Probabilistic signature embedding in outputs
  - CanaryInputDetector:     Hidden trap inputs to detect scraping
  - ExtractionRiskScorer:    Aggregated risk score driving response degradation

Quick start:
    from security.model_extraction_defense import ExtractionDefenseLayer

    defense = ExtractionDefenseLayer.from_env()
    pre = defense.pre_request(api_key, ip, features, model_name)
    if not pre.blocked:
        post = defense.post_response(api_key, raw_output, features)
