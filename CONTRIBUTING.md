# Contributing to Aether

## Development Setup

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/DammnThatsCrazy/Aether.git
cd Aether
pip install -e ".[dev,backend,ml]"

# Install Node workspace deps (shared, web, react-native, shiki)
npm ci

# Run tests
make test
npm test

# Start local infrastructure only (no application services)
docker compose up -d postgres redis kafka zookeeper clickhouse

# Start backend in dev mode
export AETHER_ENV=local
make serve-backend          # backend → http://localhost:8000
make serve-ml               # ML serving → http://localhost:8080

# Optional: start the Shiki operator control surface
cd apps/shiki && npm run dev   # → http://localhost:5174

# Full stack via docker compose (backend + ml + shiki + infra)
docker compose up -d
# → backend   http://localhost:8000
# → ml-serving http://localhost:8080
# → shiki     http://localhost:8081   (host port 8081 -> container 8080)
```

## Environment

Set `AETHER_ENV=local` for development. This enables in-memory fallbacks for all infrastructure (Redis, PostgreSQL, Neptune, Kafka). No external services are required for local development.

## Code Standards

- Python 3.10+
- Node 18+
- Formatting: `ruff format .`
- Linting: `ruff check .` and `npm run lint`
- Type hints on all public functions
- Docstrings on all classes and public methods

## Testing

```bash
make test              # All tests
make test-security     # Extraction defense tests only
make test-ml           # ML model tests only
```

Tests must pass locally and in CI before merge.

## Branching

- `main` — production-ready code
- Feature branches — `feat/description`
- Bugfix branches — `fix/description`

## Commit Messages

Follow conventional commits:
- `feat:` new feature
- `fix:` bug fix
- `docs:` documentation only
- `refactor:` code restructuring
- `test:` adding/updating tests

## Pull Requests

1. Create a branch from `main`
2. Make changes with tests
3. Run `make test` locally
4. Push and create PR
5. CI must pass before merge
6. Squash merge to `main`
