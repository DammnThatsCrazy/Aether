Aether Agent Layer — Graph Staging Interface
Explicit interface between the agent layer and the graph/lake systems.
The agent layer stages mutations here; approved mutations are committed
through graph interfaces.

This module does NOT own the graph storage implementation (PostgreSQL,
Neptune, etc.) — it provides the agent-layer-side staging contract.
