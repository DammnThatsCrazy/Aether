# Data Classification Policy

**Repository:** Aether
**Date:** 2026-03-25
**Scope:** All data objects, storage backends, graph edges, and ML pipelines

---

## 1. Classification Taxonomy

Aether uses a 7-tier data classification system. Every data object, field, graph edge, and derived artifact must be assigned exactly one classification tier. When an object qualifies for multiple tiers, the highest (most restrictive) tier applies.

| Tier | Label | Examples |
|------|-------|----------|
| 1 | **PUBLIC** | Marketing content, public docs, product descriptions |
| 2 | **INTERNAL** | Internal metrics, operational data, config settings |
| 3 | **CONFIDENTIAL** | Business logic, API contracts, model architectures |
| 4 | **SENSITIVE_PII** | Email, phone, name, address, date of birth |
| 5 | **FINANCIAL** | Account numbers, balances, positions, trades, KYC/KYB records |
| 6 | **REGULATED** | Beneficial ownership, AML/sanctions flags, compliance actions, wallet-to-identity links |
| 7 | **HIGHLY_SENSITIVE** | Raw passwords (never stored), encryption keys, master secrets, SSN/TIN |

## 4. Classification Enforcement

### Assignment

- Every new data object, field, graph edge, or derived artifact MUST be assigned a classification tier before it enters any storage backend.
- Classification is assigned via policy metadata attached to the object at creation time.
- If no classification is explicitly assigned, the object defaults to **CONFIDENTIAL** and is flagged for review.

### Elevation

- When a data object qualifies for multiple tiers, the highest (most restrictive) tier applies.
- Elevation events (e.g., wallet address linked to identity) must be logged and the classification updated in real time.

### Validation

- All API routes that create, update, or return data objects must validate that the requesting user's role and active consent satisfy the classification tier's access requirements.
- Field-level access control must mask or deny fields that exceed the requester's clearance.

### Audit

- Classification assignments and changes are logged to the immutable audit trail.
- Quarterly reviews of the object-to-classification mapping are required to capture new data objects and reclassifications.
