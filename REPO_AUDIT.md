# Aether Repository Audit — Ground Truth

**Date:** 2026-03-24
**Scope:** Full monorepo inspection against provided architecture docs

## A. Runtime Surfaces

### Python/FastAPI Backend: FULLY IMPLEMENTED
- **Entry:** `Backend Architecture/aether-backend/main.py`
- **Services:** 22 routers (19 core + 3 feature-flagged Intelligence Graph)
- **Endpoints:** 120+ with real implementations
- **Status:** Production-grade with real backends (PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka, Neptune)

### Node/TypeScript Data Layer: PARTIAL
- **Data Ingestion Layer** (`Data Ingestion Layer/`): TypeScript scaffolding only — types, config, utils, but no runnable ingestion service
- **Data Lake Architecture** (`Data Lake Architecture/aether-Datalake-backend/`): Real ETL implementation — scheduler, Bronze→Silver→Gold pipelines, S3 integration

## B. Storage Reality

| Store | Status | Evidence |
|-------|--------|----------|
| PostgreSQL | **Implemented** | asyncpg pool in `repositories/repos.py`, auto-table creation |
| Redis | **Implemented** | redis.asyncio in `shared/cache/cache.py`, auth, rate limiting |
| Neptune | **Implemented** | gremlinpython in `shared/graph/graph.py`, 18 vertex types, 48+ edge types |
| Kafka | **Implemented** | aiokafka in `shared/events/events.py`, 40+ topics |
| S3 | **Partial** | Used in ML batch predictor and feature pipeline; not wired for lake storage from backend |
| DynamoDB | **Config only** | Settings class exists, no client code |
| OpenSearch | **Config only** | Settings class exists, no client code |
| ClickHouse | **Docker only** | In compose but no backend code references |
| Snowflake | **Not present** | No references in codebase |
| SNS/SQS | **Config option** | Listed as Kafka alternative, no implementation |

## C. Ingestion Reality

### Existing Endpoints
- `POST /v1/ingest/events` — single SDK event
- `POST /v1/ingest/events/batch` — batch up to 500 events
- `POST /v1/ingest/feed` — external API feed

### Provider Adapters (9 implemented)
- QuickNode, Alchemy, Infura, Generic RPC (blockchain)
- Etherscan, Moralis (block explorer)
- Twitter, Reddit (social)
- Dune Analytics (analytics data)

All use real httpx HTTP calls with health checks.

### Missing Provider Paths (from docs)
- DeFiLlama, CoinGecko, Binance, Coinbase (market data)
- Polymarket, Kalshi (prediction markets)
- Farcaster, Lens, GitHub (social/dev)
- Chainalysis, Nansen (on-chain intelligence)
- Massive, Databento (TradFi)

### ETL/Batch
- Data Lake ETL scheduler: real TypeScript implementation
- ML Feature Pipeline: real Python implementation

## D. Graph Reality

### Backend: Neptune via gremlinpython (production) / in-memory (local)
### Layers: H2H, H2A, A2H, A2A — all implemented with edge classification
### Feature Flags: 7 Intelligence Graph flags (all default false)
### Scoring: Trust score composite (weighted ML outputs), bytecode risk scorer (rule-based)

## E. ML Reality

| Model | Config | Training | Serving | Features |
|-------|--------|----------|---------|----------|
| Intent Prediction | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Bot Detection | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Session Scoring | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Identity Resolution | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Journey Prediction | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Churn Prediction | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| LTV Prediction | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Anomaly Detection | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Campaign Attribution | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Bytecode Risk | ✅ | N/A (rule-based) | ✅ | N/A |
| Trust Score | ✅ | N/A (composite) | ✅ | N/A |

**Critical gap:** No trained model artifacts (.pkl/.pt) in repo. Training pipeline requires mlflow + data.

## F. Deployment Reality

### Docker: 4 Dockerfiles, docker-compose with 9 services
### Staging: `deploy/staging/` with one-command bootstrap
### Terraform: Complete AWS IaC (VPC, ECS, RDS, Neptune, MSK, ElastiCache, OpenSearch, S3, ALB, CloudFront, WAF)
### CI/CD: GitHub Actions workflow with tests, doc validation, syntax checks
### Secrets: Generation script + rotation runbook

## What Was Preserved
- All 22 FastAPI service routers
- All 11 ML model/scorer paths
- Neptune graph with 4 relationship layers
- All 9 provider adapters
- Data Lake ETL scheduler
- Terraform IaC modules
- Docker Compose stack
- CI/CD workflow

## What Was Completed (Prior Sessions)
- All infrastructure stubs replaced with real backends
- Oracle signing/verification with real secp256k1 ECDSA
- Async middleware auth + distributed rate limiting
- Admin API key provisioning
- Environment gating (no silent fallback in staging/prod)
- 4 subsystem docs + secret rotation runbook + contributing guide
- Staging deployment package

## What Remains Blocked By External Prerequisites
1. **ML model training artifacts** — requires mlflow + training data + compute
2. **Cloud infrastructure** — requires AWS credentials for managed services
3. **Production secrets** — requires secret manager deployment
4. **Missing provider connectors** — DeFiLlama, CoinGecko, Binance, Coinbase, Polymarket, Kalshi, Farcaster, etc.
5. **DynamoDB/OpenSearch/ClickHouse client code** — config exists but no implementation
6. **Snowflake warehouse path** — not present in codebase
7. **Node.js ingestion service** — scaffolding only, no runnable endpoints
