## Entity Model (21 Entity Types)

## Identity Linking Model

### Direct Deterministic Links
High-confidence links based on unique identifiers with exact matching.

| Signal Type | Match Logic | Confidence | Example |
|-------------|------------|------------|---------|
| `email` | Exact match on normalized email | 0.95 | user@example.com links bank profile to brokerage profile |
| `phone` | Exact match on E.164 normalized phone | 0.90 | +1-555-0100 links mobile app to KYC record |
| `ssn_hash` | Exact match on SHA-256 hash of SSN | 0.99 | Hashed SSN links tax record to brokerage account |
| `account_number_hash` | Exact match on SHA-256 hash of account number | 0.98 | Hashed account links bank statement to funding source |
| `wallet_address` | Exact match on checksummed address | 1.00 | 0xabc... links on-chain activity to custody record |

### Inferred Probabilistic Links
Lower-confidence links based on behavioral or environmental signals.

| Signal Type | Match Logic | Base Confidence | Decay |
|-------------|------------|-----------------|-------|
| `device_fingerprint` | Canvas, WebGL, font, plugin hash similarity | 0.70 | Decays 0.05/month without re-observation |
| `session_continuity` | Same session crosses domain boundaries | 0.65 | Expires with session |
| `behavioral_continuity` | Similar interaction patterns across platforms | 0.50 | Decays 0.10/month |
| `domain_app_usage` | Same user accesses related applications | 0.45 | Decays 0.08/month |
| `ip_clustering` | Shared IP address within time window | 0.40 | Decays 0.15/month |

### Confidence Weighting
- All links carry a `confidence` score in the range `[0.0, 1.0]`
- Confidence is computed as: `base_confidence * recency_factor * corroboration_factor`
- `recency_factor`: exponential decay based on time since last observation
- `corroboration_factor`: multiplicative boost when multiple independent signals agree (capped at 1.0)
- Source attribution: every link records `source_provider`, `source_system`, `observed_at`

### Reversibility and Provenance
- All links are stored with full provenance: `created_at`, `created_by`, `evidence[]`
- Every merge operation is reversible via `split` with audit trail
- Evidence chain: each link references the raw signals that produced it
- Deletion propagation: GDPR erasure removes links and underlying evidence

### Cross-Domain Linking
- **bank_account_holder <-> brokerage_owner**: Linked via SSN hash, email, or phone with confidence scoring
- **brokerage_owner <-> wallet_owner**: Linked via funding flow (fiat withdrawal to crypto deposit), email, or KYC match
- **bank_account_holder <-> wallet_owner**: Transitive link with confidence decay: `conf(A->C) = conf(A->B) * conf(B->C) * 0.9`
- All cross-domain links carry a `join_type` field: `deterministic`, `probabilistic`, `transitive`

## Confidence and Completeness Model

### CompletenessStatus Enum
Aligned with the existing Web3 completeness model for consistency across domains.

```
enum CompletenessStatus {
  RAW_OBSERVED    = "raw_observed"       // Data ingested but not validated
  PARTIALLY_ENRICHED = "partially_enriched"  // Some enrichment applied
  CROSS_REFERENCED = "cross_referenced"   // Validated against secondary source
  HIGH_CONFIDENCE = "high_confidence"     // Multiple sources confirm, all fields populated
}
```

### Confidence Scoring
```
ConfidenceMetadata {
  object_id:          uuid
  object_type:        string
  completeness:       CompletenessStatus
  confidence_score:   decimal [0.0, 1.0]
  field_confidence:   map<string, decimal>  // per-field confidence scores
  sources:            SourceAttribution[]
  last_validated_at:  timestamp
  validation_count:   integer
}

SourceAttribution {
  provider_id:        uuid -> provider_registry
  source_type:        enum (primary | secondary | derived | inferred)
  confidence_weight:  decimal [0.0, 1.0]
  observed_at:        timestamp
  staleness_threshold: duration
}
```

### Source Confidence Inheritance
- Each provider in the provider registry carries a `base_confidence` score
- Data ingested from a provider inherits `min(provider.base_confidence, signal.confidence)`
- Derived data carries `parent_confidence * derivation_factor` where `derivation_factor < 1.0`
- Cross-referenced data gets `min(1.0, source_a.confidence + source_b.confidence * 0.5)`

### Provider Confidence Defaults

| Provider | Type | Base Confidence |
|----------|------|----------------|
| Exchange direct feed | Primary | 0.99 |
| Custodian report | Primary | 0.95 |
| KYC provider | Primary | 0.92 |
| Databento | Primary | 0.95 |
| Massive | Secondary | 0.80 |
| CoinGecko | Secondary | 0.85 |
| User self-reported | Secondary | 0.60 |
| Inferred/derived | Derived | 0.50 |

## Point-in-Time Model

### Temporal Dimensions

| Dimension | Description | Use Case |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| `effective_at` | When the state was true in reality | "This position was opened on 2024-03-15" |
| `observed_at` | When the system learned about this state | "We ingested this position record on 2024-03-16" |
| `as_of` | Query parameter for point-in-time reconstruction | "Show me the portfolio as it was known on 2024-03-16" |
| `version` | Monotonic version counter per object | "This is the 4th update to this position record" |

### Bi-Temporal Schema Pattern
Every mutable entity in the ontology carries the following temporal fields:

```
BiTemporalFields {
  effective_at:       timestamp   // NOT NULL, when the fact became true
  effective_until:    timestamp?  // NULL = currently effective
  observed_at:        timestamp   // NOT NULL, when we recorded it
  superseded_at:      timestamp?  // NULL = current version
  version:            integer     // monotonically increasing per object_id
  previous_version:   integer?    // links to prior version for chain traversal
}
```

### Query Semantics

**Current state** (default):
```
WHERE effective_until IS NULL AND superseded_at IS NULL
```

**Point-in-time (as_of)**:
```
WHERE effective_at <= :as_of
  AND (effective_until IS NULL OR effective_until > :as_of)
  AND observed_at <= :as_of
  AND (superseded_at IS NULL OR superseded_at > :as_of)
```

**Historical reconstruction (effective_at range)**:
```
WHERE effective_at >= :start AND effective_at < :end
  AND superseded_at IS NULL  // only latest observations
ORDER BY effective_at ASC
```

### Version Chain
- Each update creates a new row with `version = previous_version + 1`
- The previous row gets `superseded_at = now()`
- Full history is preserved; no data is overwritten
- Compaction policy: archive versions older than retention period to cold storage

### Temporal Consistency Rules
- `effective_at <= observed_at` (you cannot observe something before it happens)
- `version` is unique per `object_id` and monotonically increasing
- `superseded_at` of version N equals `observed_at` of version N+1
- Backdated corrections: insert with `effective_at` in the past but `observed_at = now()`
