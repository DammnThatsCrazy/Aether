### Independent Subsystem Versions (by design)

| Subsystem | Version | Reason |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| `Backend Architecture/aether-backend/pyproject.toml` | 0.1.0 | Internal Python package, not published |
| `Agent Layer/pyproject.toml` | 0.1.0 | Internal Python package, not published |
| `ML Models/aether-ml/pyproject.toml` | 4.0.0 | Independently versioned ML package |
| `cicd/aether-cicd/pyproject.toml` | 1.0.0 | Internal CI/CD tooling |
| `AWS Deployment/aether-aws/pyproject.toml` | 1.0.0 | Internal AWS automation |
| `GDPR & SOC2/aether-compliance/pyproject.toml` | 1.0.0 | Internal compliance module |

### Version Drift Root Cause (Fixed)

**Issue:** `bump_version.py` updated the Maven publication `version = "X.Y.Z"` in `build.gradle.kts` but NOT the `buildConfigField("String", "AETHER_SDK_VERSION", ...)` on line 15. The buildConfigField is what the Android SDK actually reports at runtime.

**Fix:** Updated `update_android_version()` in `scripts/bump_version.py` to match and replace BOTH version locations in the gradle file. This drift cannot recur.

### Documents Fixed

| Document | Was | Now |
|----------|-----|-----|
| `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` | "24 service routers" | "29 service routers" |
| `Backend Architecture/README.md` | "21 microservices", "95+ endpoints" | "29 microservices", "184 endpoints" |
| `docs/PRODUCTION-READINESS.md` | "All 22 backend services" | "All 29 backend services" |

---

## 3. Provider Count Truth

### 24 Provider Connectors (all implemented)

All 24 providers exist as classes in `shared/providers/categories.py` with real `httpx` HTTP calls, `execute()` methods, and `health_check()` implementations.

| Category | Providers | Count |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| Blockchain RPC | QuickNode, Alchemy, Infura, Generic RPC | 4 |
| Block Explorer | Etherscan, Moralis | 2 |
| Social | Twitter/X, Reddit | 2 |
| Analytics | Dune Analytics | 1 |
| Market Data | DeFiLlama, CoinGecko, Binance, Coinbase | 4 |
| Prediction Markets | Polymarket, Kalshi | 2 |
| Web3 Social | Farcaster, Lens Protocol | 2 |
| Identity Enrichment | ENS, GitHub | 2 |
| Governance | Snapshot | 1 |
| On-chain Intelligence | Chainalysis, Nansen | 2 |
| TradFi Data | Massive, Databento | 2 |

**Document Fixed:** `PROVIDER_MATRIX.md` updated from "16 implemented + 8 planned" to "24 implemented".

---

## 4. Infrastructure Truth

### Production Backends (all implemented)

| Component | Backend | Module | Fail-Closed |
|-----------|---------|--------|-------------|
| Repositories | PostgreSQL (asyncpg) | `repositories/repos.py` | Yes |
| Cache | Redis (redis.asyncio) | `shared/cache/cache.py` | Yes |
| Graph | Neptune (gremlinpython) | `shared/graph/graph.py` | Yes |
| Events | Kafka (aiokafka) | `shared/events/events.py` | Yes |
| Metrics | Prometheus (prometheus_client) | `shared/logger/logger.py` | Yes |
| Rate Limiting | Redis INCR+EXPIRE | `shared/rate_limit/limiter.py` | Yes |
| Auth | Redis hashed key lookup | `shared/auth/auth.py` | Yes |
| Key Vault | Fernet AES encryption | `shared/providers/key_vault.py` | Yes |
| Oracle Signing | eth_account secp256k1 | `services/oracle/signer.py` | Yes |
| Oracle Verification | keccak256 + ecrecover | `services/oracle/verifier.py` | Yes |

### Environment Gating

- `AETHER_ENV=local`: In-memory fallbacks active (development only)
- `AETHER_ENV=staging|production`: Real backends required, `RuntimeError` on missing connections

### Documents Fixed

| Document | Issue | Fix |
|----------|-------|-----|
| `docs/OPERATIONS-RUNBOOK.md` | Claimed "data persistence layer uses in-memory stubs" | Updated to reflect real PostgreSQL/Redis/Neptune/Kafka backends |
| `docs/OPERATIONS-RUNBOOK.md` | Concurrency section referenced threading locks for in-memory stores | Updated to reflect asyncpg connection pools and Redis atomic ops |
| `docs/INTELLIGENCE-GRAPH.md` | Claimed "in-memory stub (Neptune integration pending)" | Updated to "Neptune (gremlinpython) with in-memory fallback for local dev" |

---

## 5. Documentation Surface

### All 48 Markdown Files Audited

**Root-level (12):** README, CHANGELOG, CONTRIBUTING, PROVIDER_MATRIX, design docs, audit docs
**docs/ folder (17+):** Architecture, API, SDK guides, subsystem docs, runbooks
**Subsystem READMEs (8):** Backend, Agent, Data Lake, Data Ingestion, AWS, CI/CD, Compliance, ML

### Remaining "stub" References (Legitimate)

All remaining "stub" references in documentation are legitimate and describe correct behavior:
- `deploy/staging/README.md` — ML serving uses stub models unless trained artifacts provided
- `Backend Architecture/README.md` — Example using stub API key for development
- `docs/ML-TRAINING-GUIDE.md` — Describes fallback to stub models in dev
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md` — Historical entries describing what was replaced
- `docs/INTELLIGENCE-GRAPH.md` — Stub API keys restricted to LOCAL env only
- `AWS Deployment/aether-aws/README.md` — AWS stub mode for CI/demo environments

### No Stale "simulated", "placeholder", "TODO", "coming soon"

All instances of these keywords in active documentation have been verified as historical audit references or legitimate behavioral descriptions.

---

## 6. Tooling Fixes

### bump_version.py

**Root Cause:** The `update_android_version()` function only matched the Maven publication `version = "..."` pattern. The `buildConfigField` line used a different pattern with escaped quotes.

**Fix Applied:** Added a second regex to `update_android_version()` that specifically matches and replaces the `buildConfigField("String", "AETHER_SDK_VERSION", ...)` pattern. Both the Maven version and the runtime constant are now updated atomically.

**Verification:** Tested regex against actual file content — matches and replaces correctly.

---

## 7. Legacy / Archive Files

### `Backend Architecture/mnt/user-data/outputs/`

Contains archived copies of service route files from earlier development iterations. These are **NOT** the active code — the active code is in `Backend Architecture/aether-backend/services/`. These files contain old stub implementations that have since been replaced.

**Decision:** These are archive/output artifacts. No action needed — they do not affect runtime behavior.

### Root-level `Backend Architecture/*.py` files

Files like `cache.py`, `repos.py`, `graph.py`, `auth.py`, `events.py` exist at the top of `Backend Architecture/` alongside the `aether-backend/` directory. These are **earlier versions** of what is now in `aether-backend/shared/`. The active code is inside `aether-backend/`.

**Decision:** These are legacy files from before the `aether-backend/` reorganization. They do not affect imports or runtime (Python only imports from `aether-backend/`).

---

## 8. Test Coverage

### Current Test Surface

| Location | Test Files | Focus |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| `tests/unit/` | 9 files | Backend guards, oracle config, RPC gateway, agent wrappers, AWS |
| `tests/integration/` | 1 file | Backend E2E |
| `tests/security/` | 1 file | Model extraction defense |
| `ML Models/aether-ml/tests/unit/` | 5 files | Common, features, models, serving |
| `ML Models/aether-ml/tests/integration/` | 2 files | API, serving |
| **Total** | **16 files** | **106+ core + 153 ML = 259+ assertions** |

### Coverage Gaps (Known)

The following services do not have dedicated test files:
- Profile 360, Population Omniview, Expectation Engine, Behavioral, RWA Intelligence
- These are v8.6.0 additions. Their API contracts are tested via the E2E test suite.

---

## 9. Release Truth

### Git Tags

| Tag | Date | Commit |
|-----|------|--------|
| v8.4.0 | 2026-03-24 | Infrastructure replacement release |
| v8.5.0 | 2026-03-24 | Intelligence Graph + Lake + Providers |
| v8.6.0 | 2026-03-25 | Profile + Population + Expectations + Behavioral + RWA |

### GitHub Releases

All three releases created via `gh release create` with comprehensive release notes.

### CHANGELOG Alignment

Both `CHANGELOG.md` (root) and `docs/CHANGELOG.md` contain matching v8.6.0 entries with accurate:
- Service count: 29
- Endpoint count: 184
- Provider count: 24
- New feature listings for all v8.6.0 additions

## 11. Remaining Items (Non-Blocking)

| Item | Priority | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Backend Architecture root legacy files | P3 | `cache.py`, `repos.py` etc. at root — not imported, but could confuse new developers |
| `mnt/user-data/outputs/` archive | P3 | Old stub copies — could be gitignored or documented |
| ML Models README version | Info | aether-ml stays at 4.0.0 by design (independent package) |
| Test coverage for v8.6.0 services | P2 | Profile, Population, Expectations, Behavioral, RWA need dedicated unit tests |
| `Data Ingestion Layer/` TypeScript scaffolding | Info | Canonical runtime is Python backend; TS layer is SDK event processing |
