## What Must NOT Be Rebuilt

### Identity Resolution Engine
- **Action**: Extend with new signal types (brokerage account, bank account, KYC identity)
- **Do NOT**: Replace the resolution algorithm, merge logic, or cluster management
- **Reason**: The probabilistic/deterministic dual-mode resolver is battle-tested and handles billions of link evaluations

### Graph Infrastructure
- **Action**: Add new vertex types (financial_account, instrument, institution) and edge types (holds_position, executes_trade, custodies_for)
- **Do NOT**: Replace Neptune backend or change traversal engine
- **Reason**: Neptune handles the current 44 vertex types and 70+ edge types at scale; adding more is incremental

### Ingestion Pipeline
- **Action**: Add new event types (quote_lookup, order_placed, trade_executed) and feed sources (brokerage_feed, bank_feed, market_data_feed)
- **Do NOT**: Replace the SDK event schema, batch processor, or dead-letter routing
- **Reason**: The pipeline already handles schema validation, dedup, and routing for arbitrary payloads

### Web3 Registries
- **Action**: Reuse the registry pattern (chain_registry, protocol_registry, app_registry) for TradFi equivalents (venue_registry, instrument_registry, institution_registry)
- **Do NOT**: Build a separate registry framework
- **Reason**: The registry pattern (enum + metadata + validation) is proven and consistent

### RWA Service
- **Action**: It already models TradFi-adjacent assets (treasury, private_credit, trade_finance); extend with pure TradFi instruments
- **Do NOT**: Create a parallel asset modeling service
- **Reason**: RWA's 14 asset classes, 7 policy types, and 11 cashflow types overlap significantly with TradFi modeling needs

### Fraud Engine
- **Action**: Add new signals (wash_trading_score, front_running_score, insider_trading_score, account_takeover_score)
- **Do NOT**: Replace the composable signal architecture or scoring pipeline
- **Reason**: The 9-signal composable engine is designed for extension; new signals plug in without changing the aggregation logic

### Commerce Service
- **Action**: Extend payment types to include ACH, wire, brokerage sweep, margin call
- **Do NOT**: Replace PaymentRecord, x402, or FeeElimination
- **Reason**: The payment lifecycle model generalizes to any rail; new rails are additive

### Profile 360 Composer
- **Action**: Add new data source adapters (brokerage_profile, bank_profile, advisor_profile)
- **Do NOT**: Replace the composition engine or rendering pipeline
- **Reason**: The composer already handles multi-source profile assembly with conflict resolution

## Gap Analysis (16 Gaps)

### Gap 1: No Brokerage/Bank/Custodian Entity Types
- **Current state**: Company vertex exists but is not specialized for financial institutions
- **Impact**: Cannot distinguish between a SaaS vendor and a broker-dealer in the graph
- **Required**: Specialized vertex types with regulatory metadata (CRD number, LEI, charter type)

### Gap 2: No Financial Account Model
- **Current state**: No representation of balances, positions, or portfolio state
- **Impact**: Cannot track user holdings, calculate exposure, or reconstruct portfolio history
- **Required**: Account entity with type taxonomy, balance snapshots, and position tracking

### Gap 3: No Market Instrument Model
- **Current state**: No representation of stocks, ETFs, options, bonds, or funds
- **Impact**: Cannot reference what users hold, trade, or are exposed to
- **Required**: Instrument registry with identifiers (CUSIP, ISIN, FIGI, ticker), classification, and metadata

### Gap 4: No Trade Lifecycle Model
- **Current state**: No representation of orders, executions, or settlements
- **Impact**: Cannot track trading activity, calculate realized P&L, or detect patterns
- **Required**: Full order-to-settlement lifecycle with status tracking and venue attribution

### Gap 5: No TradFi Identity Signals
- **Current state**: Identity resolution uses email, phone, wallet, fingerprint, IP only
- **Impact**: Cannot link users across brokerage accounts, bank accounts, or KYC records
- **Required**: New signal types: brokerage_account_owner, bank_account_holder, kyc_identity, tax_id_match

### Gap 6: No Business Application Entity Types
- **Current state**: No CRM, support, billing, or product analytics objects
- **Impact**: Cannot model Web2 application data (Salesforce contacts, Zendesk tickets, Stripe customers)
- **Required**: Application entity types with source system attribution and cross-reference linking

### Gap 7: No Pre-Trade Behavioral Events
- **Current state**: SDK captures page_view, click, custom but no financial intent signals
- **Impact**: Cannot track quote lookups, watchlist additions, order ticket interactions, or chart engagement
- **Required**: New event types in the ingestion pipeline with financial context fields

### Gap 8: No Funding Flow Tracking
- **Current state**: PaymentRecord exists but no ACH/wire/card-to-brokerage-to-wallet flow modeling
- **Impact**: Cannot trace the path of money from bank to brokerage to crypto wallet
- **Required**: Funding flow edges in the graph connecting accounts across rails with timing and amount

### Gap 9: No Legal/Beneficial Owner Distinction
- **Current state**: Graph has OWNS_WALLET but no differentiation between legal owner, beneficial owner, authorized user
- **Impact**: Cannot model trusts, custodial accounts, omnibus structures, or corporate ownership
- **Required**: Owner type taxonomy with relationship edges and regulatory classification

### Gap 10: No Advisor/Broker/Agent Relationship Modeling
- **Current state**: No representation of advisory relationships, broker assignments, or agent authority
- **Impact**: Cannot track who advises whom, discretionary vs. non-discretionary, or fiduciary obligations
- **Required**: Relationship edges with role, authority level, and temporal validity

### Gap 11: No Compliance/Risk Path Reasoning Across Domains
- **Current state**: Fraud engine scores individual signals but cannot traverse cross-domain compliance paths
- **Impact**: Cannot answer "does this person's bank activity connect to suspicious on-chain behavior?"
- **Required**: Graph traversal queries that cross domain boundaries with compliance-aware edge weighting

### Gap 12: No Point-in-Time Portfolio/Account Reconstruction
- **Current state**: No temporal versioning of account or position state
- **Impact**: Cannot answer "what did this portfolio look like on date X?" or perform historical analysis
- **Required**: Bi-temporal model (effective_at + observed_at) with version counters and snapshot reconstruction

### Gap 13: No Market Data Ingestion Pipeline
- **Current state**: Massive and Databento providers exist in the registry but no ingestion jobs consume their data
- **Impact**: Provider integrations are dormant; no price, volume, or reference data flows into the lake
- **Required**: Ingestion jobs per provider with scheduling, normalization, and lake routing

### Gap 14: No Corporate Action Tracking
- **Current state**: No representation of splits, dividends, mergers, spin-offs, or reorganizations
- **Impact**: Cannot adjust position history, calculate total return, or maintain accurate cost basis
- **Required**: Corporate action event model with instrument linkage and position adjustment logic

### Gap 15: No Cross-Domain Join Scoring
- **Current state**: Identity resolution operates within signal types; no confidence score for bank-to-brokerage-to-wallet chains
- **Impact**: Cannot express "we are 87% confident this bank account holder is also this wallet owner"
- **Required**: Cross-domain join model with transitive confidence decay and evidence aggregation

### Gap 16: No Household/Family Entity Grouping
- **Current state**: IdentityCluster groups signals for one person; no multi-person household concept
- **Impact**: Cannot model family accounts, household-level exposure, or related-person compliance checks
- **Required**: Household entity with membership edges, role designations, and aggregate metrics
