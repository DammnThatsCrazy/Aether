Aether Privacy — Consent Enforcement at Processing Time

Enforces consent state at actual processing points, not just storage.
Called by middleware, async jobs, enrichment pipelines, and export paths.

Consent purposes: analytics, marketing, web3, agent, commerce
Enforcement behavior: fail-closed — disallowed processing is blocked.
