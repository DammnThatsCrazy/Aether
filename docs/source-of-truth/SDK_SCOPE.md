# SDK Scope

## What the Aether SDK IS

A **thin, observation-only capture layer** that runs on the client (browser,
iOS, Android, React Native) and emits canonical events to the Aether backend
via a single HTTP batch endpoint.

The SDK is responsible for:

1. Building and maintaining **anonymous identity** + session state.
2. **Hydrating** identity when the host app knows a user / wallet / tenant.
3. Capturing **core analytics**: track, page/screen, conversion, heartbeat.
4. Capturing **wallet and transaction** events when the host app has web3
   context.
5. Capturing **deep-link / campaign / referrer** signals.
6. Capturing **push-open** events on native platforms.
7. Enforcing **consent gating** locally before transport.
8. Offering thin, typed **emitters** for commerce / agent / x402 events when
   the host app wants to report them (backend does all the orchestration).
9. **Batching, retrying, and persisting** events until they reach
   `POST /v1/batch`.
10. Fetching a **capability manifest** from `GET /v1/config`.

## What the Aether SDK IS NOT

The SDK does NOT:

- Classify wallets (hot/cold/smart/exchange).
- Compute DeFi positions, NFT holdings, portfolio value, whale thresholds.
- Score fraud, trust, or risk.
- Resolve identity clusters or link cross-device profiles.
- Run approval workflows, settle payments, or grant entitlements.
- Derive ground truth for agent decisions.
- Host ML models.
- Maintain a business graph.
- Decide what is or is not "valuable" activity.

All of that is backend responsibility. The SDK's job is to observe and
deliver observations.

## Design invariants

- **One batch endpoint**: every platform POSTs `POST /v1/batch`.
- **One event envelope**: every event conforms to `BaseEvent` in
  `packages/shared/events.ts`.
- **One consent model**: every SDK recognises the same 5 purposes.
- **No backend duplication**: workflow logic never lives in the client.
- **Optional tiers are optional**: commerce, agent, wallet, x402 surfaces
  only activate when the host app calls them.
