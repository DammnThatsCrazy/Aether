# Platform Parity

Parity is declared explicitly. Forced parity is not pursued; capabilities are
placed into tiers.

## Tiers

- **Tier A** — required across all four SDKs. Release blocker if missing.
- **Tier B** — required for Web + React Native; optional / best-effort on
  native iOS / Android.
- **Tier C** — web-only or platform-specific by design.

Legend: ✔ shipped, ✗ absent (Tier B = acceptable; Tier A = release blocker),
— not applicable.

## Policy

- A **Tier A gap** must block the release and is tracked as NEEDS UPDATE.
- A **Tier B gap** is acceptable. Add it when the host platform demands it.
- A **Tier C capability** is platform-idiomatic and will never be ported.

## Current Tier A gaps

None. All Tier A rows are satisfied.

## Current Tier B gaps (open follow-ups)

- Native rewards client (web only today).
- Native multi-VM wallet methods (web only today).
- Native thin commerce/agent/x402 emitters (web only today).
- Native offline queue persistence (web only today).
