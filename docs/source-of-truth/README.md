# Source of Truth

This directory is **the** authoritative description of SDK behavior in this
monorepo. Every file here is derived from code that actually runs:
`packages/shared/*.ts`, `packages/{web,ios,android,react-native}/**`,
`Backend Architecture/aether-backend/**`, `Data Lake Architecture/**`.

If another doc contradicts a file in this directory, this directory wins.
