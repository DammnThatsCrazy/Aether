# Agentic Commerce — Approval Model

**Locked requirement:** Mandatory approval on ALL spend classes at Day-1 GA.

## States

```
pending → assigned → (approved | rejected | escalated | expired | revoked)
escalated → assigned | approved | rejected | expired
approved → revoked
```

## SLA defaults

| Priority | SLA |
|---|---|
| critical | 5 minutes |
| high | 15 minutes |
| normal | 1 hour |
| low | 4 hours |

Configurable per tenant via `ApprovalService` SLA_SECONDS dict.

## Enforcement layers

1. **Policy engine** (`policies.py`): marks `requires_approval=True` for every spend class via `mandatory_approval_all_spend_classes` active rule.
2. **Control plane** (`control_plane.py:apply_decision`): rejects payment authorization if approval status is not `approved`.
3. **Authorization flow** (`control_plane.py:authorize_payment`): hard-fails if `approval.status != APPROVED`.
4. **Graph writes** (`economic_mutations.py`): `GRANTS_ACCESS_TO` edge never written without approval reference.

## Operator actions (SHIKI Review page)

| Action | Permission | Result |
|---|---|---|
| View queue | `approvals:read` (canViewAll) | Filtered/sorted queue |
| Assign | `approvals:write` | Sets `assigned_to` |
| Approve | `commerce:approve` (canApprove) | Status → `approved`, emits `commerce.approval.approved` |
| Reject | `commerce:approve` (canApprove) | Status → `rejected` |
| Escalate | `commerce:approve` (canApprove) | Status → `escalated`, appends to escalation chain |
| Revoke (post-approval) | `approvals:write` | Status → `revoked`, cancels downstream entitlement |
| Replay (Lab) | `approvals:read` | Deterministic re-evaluation, no mutation |
| View evidence | `approvals:read` | Returns approval + policy decision + requirement |

## Override

`apply_decision(action="approve", is_override=True)` bypasses a policy-denied request.
Requires `commerce:admin`. Always audited with `COMMERCE_APPROVAL_OVERRIDE` action.
Event emitted with `is_override=true` flag.

## Self-service opt-down

`commerce_approval_required_all` config flag can only be disabled by tenant admin
with audit record. Day-1 default and GA lock: always `true`.
