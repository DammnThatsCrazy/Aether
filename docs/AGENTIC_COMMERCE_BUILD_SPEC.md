# Aether Agentic Commerce — Day-1 Build Specification

**Document:** Production build spec for extending Aether's x402/commerce/graph foundation into a fully productized Aether-native Agentic Commerce control plane.
**Scope:** Extension of existing monorepo. Not a rewrite. Not a refactor.
**Day-1 GA anchor:** All Aether-native protected resource classes, mandatory approval on all spend classes, USDC on Base + Solana.
**External providers:** Designed-in, shipped second-wave.

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Aether already has a capture-side x402 subsystem (L3b) and a commerce layer (L3a) that observe and record payments into a graph. This spec upgrades both into a **graph-native commerce control plane** that issues challenges, governs spend via mandatory approvals, verifies and settles payments, mints entitlements, and grants access — all surfaced through SHIKI as the operator command surface.

**What changes:**
- `services/x402` becomes a full control plane (challenge → verify → settle → entitle → grant) on top of existing capture code.
- `services/commerce` gains economic analytics, policy evaluation, and treasury/budget modeling.
- `shared/graph` adds 18 new vertex types and 22 new edge types formalizing the full commerce lifecycle.
- A new `services/x402/approvals.py` implements mandatory operator approval for every spend class.
- SHIKI's 8 existing pages each gain real, audited, RBAC-gated economic actions wired to new `lib/api/commerce.ts`, `approvals.ts`, `entitlements.ts`, `resources.ts` adapters with Zod schemas.
- The lake gains Silver/Gold tables for the full commerce lifecycle, deterministically rebuildable into graph state.
- Stablecoin intelligence covers USDC/Base and USDC/Solana at GA with an extensible asset/network/facilitator registry.

**What does NOT change:**
- Neptune/GraphClient is preserved.
- Kafka topics are extended, not replaced.
- SHIKI's architecture (lib/api adapters, Zod, feature-hooks, PermissionGate, mocked/live modes, Lab replay) is preserved as-is.
- Existing capture endpoints remain for backward compatibility with v1 x402 ingestion.
- Existing commerce `PaymentRecord` / `AgentHireRecord` models remain as legacy entry points; new flows use canonical internal schemas.

**Day-1 GA coverage:**
- Unified Protected Resource Registry covering all Aether APIs, agent tools, priced endpoints, and service plans.
- x402 v2-native challenge issuance with v1-compatible ingest.
- Mandatory approval on every spend class, configurable but defaulted-on.
- USDC on Base + Solana with facilitator-aware verification and local verification fallback.
- Payment-Identifier idempotency and SIWX-backed entitlement reuse.
- Full lifecycle persistence, SHIKI operator actions on all 8 pages, compliance audit coverage, diagnostics/replay/reconciliation tooling.

**Out of Day-1 scope (architected, not shipped):**
- External third-party paid resource providers (second wave).
- Marketplace/discovery features.
- Auto-approved spend classes (mandatory approval everywhere at GA).
- Non-USDC stablecoins, non-Base/Solana rails (asset registry extensible).

## 2. Architecture Deltas From Current Aether

### 2.1 Existing (preserved)

| System | Current state | Preserved role |
|---|---|---|
| `services/x402/interceptor.py` | Parses 3 HTTP headers, builds `CapturedX402Transaction` | Legacy v1 ingest path; delegates to control plane |
| `services/x402/economic_graph.py` | In-memory subgraph + Neptune snapshots (`PAYS`, `CONSUMES`) | Continues as analytics projection; writes extended by control plane |
| `services/x402/routes.py` | `/v1/x402/capture`, `/graph`, `/agent/{id}` | Kept; augmented with new control-plane routes |
| `services/commerce/models.py` | `PaymentRecord`, `AgentHireRecord` | Kept as downstream analytics records, fed by control plane |
| `shared/graph/graph.py` | VertexType/EdgeType enums, GraphClient, Gremlin queries | Extended with 18 vertex types + 22 edge types |
| `shared/events/events.py` | `Topic` enum, `EventProducer` | Extended with 24 new commerce lifecycle topics |
| `middleware/middleware.py` | Auth + rate-limit + extraction defense | Gains optional `challenge_middleware` hook for protected resources |
| SHIKI `lib/api`, `lib/schemas`, feature hooks, PermissionGate | Centralized adapter pattern with Zod validation | Reused verbatim; new adapters added under same patterns |

### 2.2 New (additive)

| Component | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Commerce Control Plane | `services/x402/control_plane.py` | Orchestrates challenge → approval → verify → settle → entitle → grant |
| Challenge Middleware | `services/x402/challenge_middleware.py` | FastAPI middleware/hook that returns HTTP 402 with PAYMENT-REQUIRED for protected resources |
| Verification Engine | `services/x402/verification.py` | Facilitator-aware + local verification, chain/asset-specific verifiers |
| Settlement Tracker | `services/x402/settlement.py` | Multi-state settlement FSM (pending/verifying/settled/failed/disputed) |
| Entitlement Service | `services/x402/entitlements.py` | Access grant issuance, reuse, expiry, revocation, SIWX binding |
| Policy Engine | `services/x402/policies.py` | Price/budget/treasury/asset/network policy evaluation |
| Approval Service | `services/x402/approvals.py` | Mandatory approval workflow (request/queue/assign/decide/expire/revoke) |
| Facilitator Registry | `services/x402/facilitators.py` | Approved facilitator list, routing, health tracking |
| Pricing Engine | `services/x402/pricing.py` | Resource→price resolution with tenant overrides |
| Idempotency Store | `services/x402/idempotency.py` | Payment-Identifier dedupe, Redis-backed |

| Economic Analytics | `services/commerce/economic_analytics.py` | Service revenue, cluster spend, facilitator performance, reuse metrics |
| Graph Schema Extensions | `shared/graph/economic_schema.py` | New VertexType/EdgeType constants for commerce lifecycle |
| Graph Mutations | `shared/graph/economic_mutations.py` | Deterministic builders: challenge→graph, approval→graph, settlement→graph |
| Event Topics | `shared/events/economic_topics.py` | 24 commerce lifecycle topics |
| Event Schemas | `shared/events/economic_schemas.py` | Pydantic schemas for every commerce event payload |

### 2.3 Conceptual shift

| Before | After |
|---|---|
| x402 = **observer** that captures headers | x402 = **control plane** that issues challenges + captures legacy headers |
| Graph = **projection** of past payments | Graph = **source of truth** for lifecycle state (challenge/approval/grant/settle) |
| SHIKI = **dashboard** | SHIKI = **operator command surface** with audited actions |
| Commerce = **record-keeping** | Commerce = **governed workflow** with mandatory approvals |
| Approval = N/A | Approval = **first-class domain** across all layers |

| `aether.commerce.replay.executed` | lab/approvals | audit |
| `aether.commerce.reconciliation.task_created` | settlement/diagnostics | SHIKI Diagnostics |
| `aether.commerce.reconciliation.task_resolved` | diagnostics | lake, audit |

### 6.2 Event Schemas (`shared/events/economic_schemas.py`)

Every topic has a typed Pydantic payload with: `tenant_id`, `correlation_id`, `challenge_id` (if applicable), `actor_id`, `actor_type`, and domain-specific fields. Versioned (`schema_version`). Serialized via existing `Event.serialize()`.

### 6.3 Lake Tiers

**Bronze (raw)** — S3 partitioned by `tenant_id/date/topic/`:
- `commerce_events_raw/` — every event as JSONL

**Silver (normalized)** — Parquet, partitioned by tenant + day:
- `commerce_challenges/` — one row per challenge
- `commerce_approvals/` — one row per approval request (+ decision columns)
- `commerce_verifications/` — one row per verification attempt
- `commerce_settlements/` — one row per settlement FSM transition
- `commerce_entitlements/` — one row per grant/reuse/revoke/expire
- `commerce_access_grants/` — one row per grant
- `commerce_fulfillments/` — one row per fulfillment
- `commerce_policy_decisions/` — one row per evaluation

**Gold (aggregates)** — ClickHouse/Iceberg:
- `gold_spend_rate_1h` — spend per tenant per service per hour
- `gold_approval_latency` — percentiles per queue per day
- `gold_approval_volume` — counts per status per tenant per day
- `gold_service_revenue` — revenue per service per window
- `gold_settlement_health` — success/fail/pending rates per facilitator per chain
- `gold_facilitator_performance` — latency, verify rate, settle rate
- `gold_entitlement_reuse` — reuse count per entitlement per day
- `gold_duplicate_payment_risk` — dedup hits per tenant
- `gold_stablecoin_rail_usage` — volume per asset per network per day
- `gold_cluster_economic_anomalies` — cluster spend z-scores
- `gold_policy_denial_reasons` — top denial reasons per tenant

### 6.4 Rebuildability

Graph state in Neptune for commerce vertices/edges MUST be deterministically rebuildable from Silver tables. `shared/graph/economic_mutations.py` exposes:
- `rebuild_from_silver(tenant_id, since)` — replays commerce Silver records into graph mutations
- `verify_graph_consistency(tenant_id)` — compares Silver aggregates to graph traversal counts
- `reconciliation_drift(tenant_id)` — returns drift per vertex/edge type

This is exercised by the nightly reconciliation job and exposed via Diagnostics API.

## 7. Approval Model Specification

### 7.1 Mandatory approval at GA

At launch, **every spend-bearing access path** passes through `ApprovalService`. The config flag `commerce_approval_required_all=true` is the Day-1 default and cannot be set to false by self-service. Per-tenant opt-down requires explicit admin action with audit record.

### 7.2 States & transitions

```
pending → assigned → (approved | rejected | escalated | expired | revoked)
escalated → assigned (reassignment) | approved | rejected | expired
approved → revoked
```

All transitions persist to `approvals` Postgres table + emit event + write graph edge + write audit record.

### 7.3 ApprovalRequest model

```
ApprovalRequest {
  id, tenant_id, challenge_id, resource_id, requester_id (agent/user),
  amount_usd, asset, network, facilitator_id, priority (low|normal|high|critical),
  reason, context (dict), policy_decision_id, created_at, expires_at,
  status, assigned_to, decided_at, decided_by, decision_reason,
  escalation_chain[], evidence_bundle_url, replay_hash
}
```

### 7.4 Queue & assignment

- Queue backed by Postgres with Redis index for fast filter/sort.
- Default assignment: round-robin within approver pool, with capacity limits.
- Manual assignment from SHIKI Command/Review.
- SLA: `normal` expires in 1h, `high` in 15m, `critical` in 5m. Configurable per tenant.

### 7.5 Decision inputs

Approver sees in SHIKI Review:
- Challenge detail + resource detail
- Policy decision chain with rationale
- Budget/treasury impact preview
- Requester economic history (spend rate, denial rate)
- Duplicate-payment risk flag
- Facilitator health
- Graph impact preview (which edges/vertices will be written)
- Evidence bundle (related receipts, prior approvals, linked entitlements)

### 7.6 Override

`decide(action=override, reason=required)` allows admin-level bypass of a policy-denied request. Override is:
- Requires `commerce:admin` scope
- Always audited with reason
- Always emits `approval.approved` event with `override=true` flag
- Flagged in SHIKI Review with distinct visual treatment

### 7.7 Replay

`POST /v1/approvals/{id}/replay` executes the approval in deterministic mock mode in Lab:
- Re-evaluates policies with original context
- Shows decision tree
- Does not mutate graph or emit production events
- Writes to `commerce_replay_log` table

### 7.8 Revoke

Approved requests can be revoked before settlement. Revoke:
- Cancels pending settlement attempts
- Marks entitlement (if minted) as revoked
- Emits `approval.revoked` + `entitlement.revoked` events
- Audits

### 7.9 Enforcement points

| Point | Enforcement |
|---|---|
| `ChallengeMiddleware` | Issues challenge but does not grant access until approval present |
| `control_plane.apply_decision` | Rejects if approval missing/expired/revoked |
| `entitlements.mint` | Requires valid approval_id in input |
| `graph writes` | `GRANTS_ACCESS_TO` edge never written without approval reference |

- Every mutation passes through PermissionGate.
- Every action emits `aether.commerce.shiki.action_logged` event with: `page`, `action`, `actor_id`, `tenant_id`, `target_id`, `result`.
- Mock mode: uses fixtures in `src/fixtures/commerce.ts` etc., no network.
- Staging: hits staging backend, real data, non-production events.
- Production: defaults to observer posture; action permissions must be explicitly granted via RBAC.
- Lab replay is deterministic: fixtures + replay seeds stored in `src/fixtures/commerce-replay/`.
- Every action-capable panel has e2e Playwright test covering auth/gated/loading/empty/error/success paths.

## 9. Stablecoin Support Specification

### 9.1 Day-1 assets

| Asset | Chain | Network | CAIP-2 | Contract/Mint | Decimals | Facilitator compat |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| USDC | Base | mainnet | `eip155:8453` | `0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913` | 6 | Aether-local, Circle, facilitator-v2 |
| USDC | Solana | mainnet | `solana:mainnet` | `EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v` | 6 | Aether-local, Circle, facilitator-v2 |

### 9.2 Asset metadata (`STABLECOIN_ASSET` vertex)

```
{
  symbol, chain, network, caip2, issuer, contract_address, decimals,
  settlement_scheme (on-chain|facilitator|hybrid),
  facilitator_ids[], tenant_allow_state, treasury_preference_score,
  normalization_rules, risk_metadata, resource_compatibility[],
  created_at, active
}
```

### 9.3 Extensibility

- Adding a new asset = inserting a `STABLECOIN_ASSET` vertex + config. No code change.
- Adding a new network = adding chain metadata + verifier plugin in `verification.py`.
- Adding a new facilitator = `POST /v1/x402/facilitators` with endpoint, capabilities, approved asset list.
- Per-tenant asset allow/deny via `ACCEPTS_ASSET` edges with `tenant_id` property.

### 9.4 Verification by chain

- **Base (USDC):** `BaseUSDCVerifier` validates tx_hash on Base RPC, checks ERC-20 Transfer event, confirms recipient/amount/confirmations.
- **Solana (USDC):** `SolanaUSDCVerifier` validates signature on Solana RPC, checks SPL Transfer, confirms recipient/amount/slot.

Both support facilitator-delegated verification as primary with local verification as fallback.

### 9.5 Out of scope

- Trading, swapping, or price discovery.
- Non-stablecoin assets.
- Non-Base/non-Solana rails (architected, not shipped).
- External provider asset catalogs (second wave).


---

## 10. Auth / Compliance / Audit Specification

### 10.1 New permission scopes (`shared/auth/auth.py`)

- `commerce:challenge`, `commerce:verify`, `commerce:settle`
- `commerce:approve`, `commerce:review`, `commerce:policy`
- `commerce:admin`, `commerce:read`
- `approvals:read`, `approvals:write`
- `entitlements:read`, `entitlements:write`
- `resources:admin`

### 10.2 SHIKI roles

| Role | Scopes |
|---|---|
| viewer | `*:read` only |
| operator | viewer + `approvals:write`, `entitlements:write`, `commerce:settle` |
| approver | operator + `commerce:approve`, `commerce:review` |
| admin | all commerce scopes including `commerce:admin`, `resources:admin`, `commerce:policy` |

### 10.3 Tenant isolation

All commerce vertices use tenant-prefixed keys. All Postgres queries filter by `tenant_id`. All events carry `tenant_id`. Cross-tenant reads denied at repo layer. Admin dashboards require explicit `tenant_scope=` parameter with audit.

### 10.4 DSR / GDPR cascade

Extend `gdpr/data_subject_rights/dsr_engine.py`:

| Object | DSR action |
|---|---|
| PAYMENT_REQUIREMENT | pseudonymize requester_id |
| APPROVAL_REQUEST/DECISION | pseudonymize requester/approver |
| ENTITLEMENT | pseudonymize holder |
| ACCESS_GRANT | pseudonymize holder |
| FULFILLMENT | pseudonymize |
| PAYMENT_RECEIPT / SETTLEMENT | retain (financial record obligation) but pseudonymize PII fields |

Cascade: user DSR → user's agents → agents' entitlements/approvals → pseudonymize across all commerce vertices.

### 10.5 Audit actions (`audit_engine.py`)

Add: `CHALLENGE_ISSUED`, `APPROVAL_REQUESTED`, `APPROVAL_DECIDED`, `APPROVAL_OVERRIDE`, `APPROVAL_REVOKED`, `VERIFICATION_COMPLETED`, `SETTLEMENT_COMPLETED`, `ENTITLEMENT_MINTED`, `ENTITLEMENT_REVOKED`, `ACCESS_GRANTED`, `ACCESS_DENIED`, `POLICY_DENIED`, `RESOURCE_REGISTERED`, `RESOURCE_UPDATED`, `FACILITATOR_REGISTERED`, `TREASURY_UPDATED`, `POLICY_UPDATED`, `SHIKI_ACTION`, `COMMERCE_OVERRIDE`.

Every transition persists to audit store with actor, timestamp, tenant, correlation_id, before/after state.

### 10.6 Privacy-aware field masking

Extend `shared/privacy/access_control.py`:
- `tx_hash`: `internal` tier, visible to `operator+`
- `wallet_address`: `confidential`, visible to `compliance+`
- `amount_usd`: `internal`, visible to `operator+`
- `payer_agent_id`: `internal`, masked for `viewer`
- `approval reason`: `confidential`, visible to `approver+`

### 10.7 Replay protection

- `Payment-Identifier` required on all verify submissions, Redis TTL 24h, dedupe returns existing capture.
- SIWX nonces for entitlement reuse.
- Settlement FSM idempotent on tx_hash.

### 10.8 Rate limiting / abuse controls

- Existing tier-based rate limiter extended with commerce-specific buckets: `challenge_rpm`, `verify_rpm`, `approval_rpm`.
- Per-tenant hard caps on pending approvals (default 10k) and open entitlements.
- Suspicious duplicate-payment pattern → circuit breaker halts tenant commerce ops + Diagnostics alert.

### 10.9 Mandatory approval enforcement

Enforced at 4 layers (see §7.9) — any bypass attempt emits `commerce.override` audit and alerts on Command page.


---

## 11. Observability / Support Specification

### 11.1 Metrics (Prometheus, extending existing `metrics` interface)

- `commerce_challenges_issued_total{tenant,resource,asset,network}`
- `commerce_approvals_requested_total{tenant,priority}`
- `commerce_approvals_decided_total{tenant,decision}`
- `commerce_approval_latency_seconds{tenant,priority}` (histogram)
- `commerce_verifications_total{tenant,facilitator,result}`
- `commerce_settlement_duration_seconds{facilitator,chain}` (histogram)
- `commerce_settlement_state{tenant,state}` (gauge)
- `commerce_entitlements_active{tenant}` (gauge)
- `commerce_entitlement_reuse_total{tenant}`

- `commerce_duplicate_payment_detected_total{tenant}`
- `commerce_graph_mutations_total{vertex_type,edge_type}`
- `commerce_reconciliation_drift{tenant,type}` (gauge)

### 11.2 Structured logs

Every commerce operation logs with: `correlation_id`, `tenant_id`, `challenge_id`, `actor_id`, `resource_id`, `action`, `result`, `duration_ms`. Logs route to existing logger infrastructure.

### 11.3 Trace IDs / request IDs

Extend existing `X-Request-ID` correlation through challenge → approval → verify → settle → entitle → grant → fulfill, all sharing a single `correlation_id`.

### 11.4 Diagnostics endpoints

- `GET /v1/diagnostics/commerce/health` — health of all commerce subsystems
- `GET /v1/diagnostics/commerce/stuck-approvals` — list stuck approvals
- `GET /v1/diagnostics/commerce/settlement-drift` — pending/failed settlements
- `GET /v1/diagnostics/commerce/reconciliation` — graph vs silver drift
- `POST /v1/diagnostics/commerce/replay/{correlation_id}` — safe replay
- `POST /v1/diagnostics/commerce/recheck/{settlement_id}` — force recheck

### 11.5 Circuit breakers

- Facilitator failure rate > 20% over 5m → pause that facilitator, route around it.
- Tenant duplicate-payment spike > 10/min → halt tenant commerce, Diagnostics alert.
- Settlement failure rate > 15% → page Command with incident.

### 11.6 Dashboards (Grafana)

- Approval Queue dashboard
- Settlement Health dashboard
- Facilitator Performance dashboard
- Stablecoin Rail Usage dashboard
- Commerce Revenue dashboard
- Reconciliation Drift dashboard

### 11.7 Alerts

- Approval latency p95 > SLA → warn
- Settlement failure rate > 5% for 10m → critical
- Facilitator health down → critical
- Reconciliation drift > 0 → warn (daily job)
- Mandatory approval bypass attempt → critical

### 11.8 Reconciliation tools

Nightly job: `reconcile_commerce(tenant_id)`:
1. Reads Silver tables
2. Replays into temp graph
3. Diffs against production graph
4. Writes drift records to `commerce_reconciliation_tasks`
5. Surfaces in SHIKI Diagnostics

### 11.9 Retry / dead-letter

- Verification retries: 3 attempts with exponential backoff before failure.
- Settlement retries: configurable per facilitator, default 5 attempts over 30m.
- Dead-letter queue for events that fail consumer processing 5x → Diagnostics surface.

### 11.10 Support answer coverage

Every support-required question in §17 has a direct diagnostic path:

| Question | Answer via |
|---|---|
| Why denied? | `GET /v1/x402/explain/{challenge_id}` → decision tree |
| Why approval required? | policy_decision_id on challenge |
| Who approved/rejected? | approval.decided_by, audit record |
| Why retried? | settlement retries[] on receipt |
| Why entitlement reused/expired? | entitlement.reuse_count, .expires_at, audit |
| Why SHIKI escalated? | event `approval.escalated` with reason |
| Which policy fired? | policy_decision.active_rules[] |
| Which facilitator/network/asset? | route on authorization |
| Settlement pending/failed? | settlement.state + retries |
| What graph state written? | `GET /v1/x402/explain/{id}` returns graph diff |
| SHIKI mock vs live? | event carries `shiki_mode` field |

### 11.11 Runbooks

See §14.

## 13. Rollout / Migration Plan

### 13.1 Feature flags

- `COMMERCE_CONTROL_PLANE_ENABLED` (master flag, default off)
- `COMMERCE_CHALLENGE_MIDDLEWARE_ENABLED` (per-tenant)
- `COMMERCE_APPROVAL_REQUIRED_ALL` (default true, locked at GA)
- `COMMERCE_FACILITATOR_VERIFY_ENABLED` (per-facilitator)
- `COMMERCE_LOCAL_VERIFY_FALLBACK` (default true)
- `COMMERCE_V2_PROTOCOL` (default true for new challenges)
- `COMMERCE_SHIKI_ACTIONS_ENABLED` (per-role, per-page)
- `IG_X402_LAYER` (existing, kept on)

### 13.2 Phased rollout

**Phase 0 — Code landed, flag off (Week 0)**
- All new modules merged behind flags.
- Existing capture path unaffected.
- Schema migrations applied (new Postgres tables).
- Neptune schema extended (enum additions, no backfill required).

**Phase 1 — Internal tenant, mock facilitators (Week 1)**
- Flag on for internal dev tenant.
- Mock facilitator for local verification.
- SHIKI in mock mode.
- Full lifecycle exercised via e2e tests.

**Phase 2 — Internal tenant, real Base/Solana verifiers (Week 2)**
- Real verifiers wired.
- Facilitator registry seeded.
- SHIKI staging mode.
- Diagnostics + reconciliation validated.

**Phase 3 — Pilot tenant (Week 3)**
- One friendly pilot tenant onboarded.
- All Aether-native protected resources registered.
- Mandatory approval enforced.
- SHIKI operator training.

**Phase 4 — GA (Week 4)**
- Flag enabled for all tenants.
- All protected resources covered.
- SHIKI action RBAC deployed.
- Runbooks published.

**Phase 5 — External providers (post-GA)**
- Second-wave scope, architected but deferred.

### 13.3 Migration of existing x402 data

- Existing `CapturedX402Transaction` records are treated as legacy v1 captures.
- Backfill job: for each legacy capture, emit synthetic `PAYMENT_REQUIREMENT` → `PAYMENT_RECEIPT` → `SETTLEMENT` (state=completed) → `ENTITLEMENT` (state=expired) vertices so historical data aligns with new schema. No mandatory approval retroactively synthesized.
- Backfill is idempotent, resumable, tenant-scoped, opt-in per tenant.

### 13.4 Rollback plan

- Disable `COMMERCE_CONTROL_PLANE_ENABLED` → new challenges fail open to existing capture flow.
- Rollback graph mutations: `shared/graph/economic_mutations.py` has inverse mutators for every forward mutator.
- Event consumers are additive; disabling flag stops event production, consumers idle.
- Postgres migrations are additive (new tables only); no destructive changes.

### 13.5 Schema migrations

- `migrations/YYYYMMDD_commerce_tables.sql` — creates all Postgres tables.
- `migrations/YYYYMMDD_commerce_indexes.sql` — indexes on tenant_id, challenge_id, approval status, settlement state.
- `migrations/YYYYMMDD_commerce_seed.sql` — seeds assets (USDC Base/Solana), default policies.

### 13.6 SDK rollout

- Web SDK: `X402PaymentEvent` already exists; add preflight client, entitlement status client.
- New SDK version bump (minor, non-breaking).
- Published after backend GA.

## 14. Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Mandatory approval creates SLA pressure | High | Auto-assignment, tiered SLAs, high-capacity approver pools, Command-page SLA dashboards |
| Facilitator outage halts paid flows | High | Multi-facilitator failover, local verification fallback, circuit breakers |
| Graph write volume spikes | Med | Batch graph mutations, existing 30s snapshot cadence preserved, backpressure |
| Duplicate payments | High | Payment-Identifier idempotency + Redis TTL + SIWX nonces + FSM idempotency |
| SHIKI action loops (unintended cascading approvals) | Med | Idempotent action keys, confirm-before-write on graph mutations, replay isolation |
| Reconciliation drift between graph and lake | Med | Nightly job, drift metric, Diagnostics surface, deterministic rebuild |
| Legacy v1 capture drift | Med | Keep legacy path functional; back-compat tests; canonicalize via `control_plane.handle_legacy_capture` |
| RBAC gaps in SHIKI | High | PermissionGate on every panel, production default observer, test coverage of denied paths |
| Override abuse | High | Admin-only scope, mandatory reason, audit trail, Command alert |
| Approval backlog stalls | High | SLA alerts, escalation chain, backlog gauges, auto-expiry |
| Cross-tenant leakage | Critical | Tenant-prefixed graph keys, repo-level tenant filters, integration test |
| Base/Solana RPC failures | Med | RPC pool, retries, fallback facilitator |
| Mock/live parity drift | Med | Parity tests in Lab, schema contracts |
| Event consumer lag | Med | DLQ, consumer lag alerts, backpressure |
| Audit log bloat | Low | Retention policy, compression, existing audit infra |
| Documentation drift | Med | Docs-as-code, PR checklist requires doc update, CHANGELOG enforced |
| External provider design debt | Low | Architected in asset/facilitator registry; clearly deferred |

## 15. Open Product Decisions Still Requiring Confirmation

1. **Approver pool composition** — Who are the default approvers per tenant? Product ops, tenant admins, or dedicated commerce-approver role? *(Recommendation: tenant admins as Day-1 default with opt-in dedicated pool.)*
2. **Default SLA values** — Confirm 5m/15m/1h for critical/high/normal or adjust per operational capacity.
3. **Treasury model** — Per-tenant single treasury vs per-agent sub-budgets at GA? *(Recommendation: per-tenant treasury + optional per-agent sub-budgets, configurable.)*
4. **Legacy v1 capture sunset** — Keep indefinitely or sunset N months post-GA?
5. **Override visibility** — Should override events surface to tenant admins or only internal ops?
6. **Facilitator cost model** — Do we charge per verification, or absorb? Affects treasury accounting.
7. **Entitlement TTL defaults** — 1h? 1 day? Per-resource configurable? *(Recommendation: per-resource, defaulted to 15m for ephemeral, 24h for subscription.)*
8. **SIWX scope** — Which chains/wallets for SIWX reuse at GA? *(Recommendation: Base + Solana only at GA, matching rail scope.)*
9. **Operator training requirement** — Is live SHIKI action access gated on training certification?
10. **Evidence bundle retention** — 90 days? 1 year? Audit requirement dictates.
11. **Cross-tenant analytics** — Allowed for global Aether ops? If yes, what anonymization?
12. **External provider integration priority** — Which external providers first in second wave?

## 16. Final Definition of Done

The Agentic Commerce Day-1 build is complete only when **every** item below is true and verified:

**Coverage**
- [ ] Every Aether-native protected resource class is registered in the Protected Resource Registry.
- [ ] Every spend class is behind mandatory approval by default.
- [ ] USDC on Base and USDC on Solana are fully operational through verification and settlement.

**Enforcement**
- [ ] Approval is enforced before final paid access at all 4 enforcement layers (middleware, control_plane, entitlements, graph writes).
- [ ] No access grant exists without a corresponding approved `APPROVAL_REQUEST`.
- [ ] Mandatory approval cannot be self-service disabled.

**Lifecycle persistence**
- [ ] Challenge, approval, verification, settlement, entitlement, access grant, fulfillment all persist to Postgres + Silver lake + graph.
- [ ] Graph state is deterministically rebuildable from Silver tables.
- [ ] Every lifecycle transition emits a typed event with correlation_id.

**SHIKI**
- [ ] All 8 SHIKI pages expose real, audited commerce actions per §8.
- [ ] Every action hits a real API, emits a real event, writes an audit entry.
- [ ] PermissionGate enforced on every action; production defaults to observer.
- [ ] Mock/staging/live parity validated by Lab tests.
- [ ] No fake "live" controls, no placeholder actions.

**Graph explainability**
- [ ] `GET /v1/x402/explain/{challenge_id}` returns full lifecycle trace.
- [ ] Graph queries answer: why access, why denied, which policy, which facilitator.

**Compliance & audit**
- [ ] Every approval/settlement/entitlement/access/policy transition is audited.
- [ ] DSR cascade covers all commerce vertex types.
- [ ] Tenant isolation verified by integration test.
- [ ] Privacy field masking applied per tier/role.

**Support**
- [ ] Every question in §11.10 has a working diagnostic path.
- [ ] Runbooks published for: stuck approval, failed settlement, facilitator outage, reconciliation drift, override review.
- [ ] Diagnostics endpoints live and tested.

**Admin**
- [ ] Admins can configure tenant commerce settings safely (approval posture, budgets, facilitators, assets, treasury).
- [ ] Config changes audited.

**Docs**
- [ ] `COMMERCE-CONTROL-PLANE.md`, `APPROVAL-MODEL.md`, `PROTECTED-RESOURCES.md`, `STABLECOIN-RAILS.md`, `SHIKI-OPERATOR-GUIDE.md`, `SUPPORT-DEBUG-GUIDE.md` all published.
- [ ] `INTELLIGENCE-GRAPH.md` amended with L3b control plane.
- [ ] CHANGELOG updated with migration notes.
- [ ] No documentation drift from code.

**Tests**
- [ ] Unit coverage ≥ 85% on new modules.
- [ ] All integration lifecycle paths tested.
- [ ] All e2e locked-requirement flows tested.
- [ ] Contract tests pin API/event schemas.
- [ ] SHIKI Playwright covers all action-capable panels.
- [ ] All tests pass in CI.

**Rollout**
- [ ] All new code behind feature flags.
- [ ] Phased rollout plan executed through Phase 4 GA.
- [ ] Rollback plan validated in staging.
- [ ] Schema migrations are additive and reversible.

**Cleanliness**
- [ ] No stubs in core paths.
- [ ] No TODO-only branches.
- [ ] No placeholder APIs.
- [ ] No graph writes that nothing reads.
- [ ] No pages without real backend effects.
- [ ] No unowned operational paths.
- [ ] No untested critical flows.

When all boxes are checked, Agentic Commerce ships.
