## Model Details

### 1. Intent Prediction (Edge)

Predicts the next user action (purchase, browse, leave) in real time from session-level features including click counts, scroll depth, timing, and device information. Uses logistic regression for sub-10ms inference with a planned upgrade path to GRU for sequential pattern capture. Exported as TF.js for browser-side deployment.

### 2. Bot Detection (Edge)

Classifies sessions as human or bot using behavioral biometrics -- mouse movement entropy, click timing variance, scroll patterns, and navigation cadence. A 100-tree Random Forest achieves reliable separation with < 5ms latency. Exported as ONNX for cross-platform edge inference.

### 3. Session Scoring (Edge)

Scores each session's engagement quality on a continuous scale, enabling real-time segmentation and trigger-based campaign activation. Runs as logistic regression in < 5ms. Exported as TF.js.

### 4. Identity Resolution (Server)

Links anonymous visitors to known identities across devices and sessions using a Graph Attention Network (GAT). Constructs a visitor graph from session, device, and behavioral similarity edges, then propagates identity labels through attention-weighted message passing. Retrained daily to incorporate new visitor data. Built with PyTorch and NetworkX.

### 5. Journey Prediction (Server)

Predicts the next steps in a user journey from ordered event sequences using an LSTM encoder-decoder architecture with attention. The encoder processes the historical sequence; the attention mechanism focuses on the most relevant past events; and the decoder generates a probability distribution over possible next actions. Retrained weekly.

### 6. Churn Prediction (Server)

Identifies users at risk of churning using XGBoost gradient-boosted trees over behavioral, transactional, and engagement features. Supports stratified cross-validation and bias auditing across demographic groups. Retrained bi-weekly on a rolling window.

### 7. Lifetime Value Prediction (Server)

Estimates customer lifetime revenue using an ensemble of three components: a BG/NBD model for purchase frequency, a Gamma-Gamma model for monetary value, and an XGBoost regressor for feature-based correction. The ensemble output is used for customer prioritization and budget allocation. Retrained weekly.

### 8. Anomaly Detection (Server)

Detects traffic anomalies, fraud patterns, and infrastructure issues from hourly aggregate metrics. Combines an Isolation Forest for unsupervised outlier detection with a PyTorch AutoEncoder for reconstruction-error-based anomaly scoring. Dual signals are merged to reduce false positives. Retrained weekly.

### 9. Campaign Attribution (Server)

Computes multi-touch marketing attribution across channels using Shapley value computation (game-theoretic fair allocation) alongside heuristic models (first-touch, last-touch, linear, time-decay). Produces per-channel contribution scores for budget optimization. Retrained weekly.

---

## Serving API

The FastAPI inference server exposes the following endpoints:

```
POST /v1/predict/intent          Real-time intent prediction
POST /v1/predict/bot             Bot vs human classification
POST /v1/predict/session-score   Session engagement scoring
POST /v1/predict/churn           Churn risk prediction
POST /v1/predict/ltv             Lifetime value estimation
POST /v1/predict/journey         Next journey step prediction
POST /v1/predict/attribution     Multi-touch campaign attribution
POST /v1/predict/batch           Batch prediction (any model)
GET  /health                     Health check
GET  /models                     List loaded models
```

All prediction endpoints accept JSON payloads with `user_id` or `session_id` and a `features` map. Responses include the prediction result, model version, and inference latency. The Redis cache layer deduplicates repeated requests within the configured TTL.

---

## Feature Pipeline

The feature layer computes inputs for all 9 models from raw event data. It supports both batch (SageMaker Processing) and streaming (Kafka / Kinesis) modes.

| Feature Group | Features | Used By |
|---------------|----------|---------|
| Session | Click counts, scroll depth, timing, device info | Intent, Session Scoring, Churn |
| Identity | Visit frequency, conversion rate, tenure | Identity Resolution, LTV |
| Behavioral | Mouse entropy, timing variance, scroll patterns | Bot Detection |
| Journey Sequences | Ordered event chains | Journey Prediction |
| Attribution Touchpoints | Channel sequences with timestamps | Campaign Attribution |
| Web3 | Transaction counts, chain usage, gas metrics | Identity Resolution, LTV, Anomaly |
| Anomaly Aggregates | Hourly traffic volumes, error rates | Anomaly Detection |

The Feature Registry (`features/registry.py`) enforces schemas, tracks lineage, and manages feature versioning.

---

## Monitoring

Production monitoring runs on a configurable interval (default: hourly) and covers four dimensions:

**Data Drift Detection**
- Population Stability Index (PSI) for numeric feature distributions
- Chi-squared test for categorical feature distributions
- Configurable thresholds with automatic alerting on breach

**Performance Monitoring**
- Tracks live model metrics against training baselines
- Detects metric degradation (accuracy, AUC, RMSE as appropriate per model)
- Champion/challenger comparison for staged rollouts

**Prediction Distribution**
- Monitors shift in prediction mean, variance, and percentiles
- Flags unexpected changes in prediction volume or distribution shape

**Alerting**
- CloudWatch custom metrics for all monitoring signals
- SNS notifications for threshold breaches
- Slack webhooks for team-level alerting
- PagerDuty integration for critical drift events

## Development

### CLI Commands (scripts/dev.sh)

```bash
bash scripts/dev.sh train <model_name|all>    # Train a model or all models
bash scripts/dev.sh serve                      # Start FastAPI inference server
bash scripts/dev.sh test                       # Run full test suite
bash scripts/dev.sh export                     # Export edge models
bash scripts/dev.sh lint                       # Run ruff + mypy
bash scripts/dev.sh docker-up                  # Start Docker Compose stack
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
bash scripts/dev.sh test

# Run unit tests only
pytest tests/unit/

# Run integration tests only
pytest tests/integration/

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=. tests/
```

Tests use synthetic data fixtures defined in `tests/conftest.py`, generating realistic data shapes for all model types without requiring access to production data.

### Linting and Type Checking

```bash
# Ruff linter (line length: 120, target: py310)
ruff check .

# Black formatter
black --check .

# Mypy strict type checking
mypy --strict .
```

### Docker

```bash
# Build multi-stage image
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile --target serving -t aether-ml:serving .
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile --target training -t aether-ml:training .

# Run full stack locally
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d

# Stack includes: Redis, MLflow, Prometheus, Jupyter
```
